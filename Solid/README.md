 App for iOS which presents you colors based on how you hold your phone.

The RGB values are defined by the angles measured by the iPhone's gyroscope. Tapping the screen pins a color, and swiping up lets you save or share it as an image.

Alternatively, the data can be forwarded to a shortcut (see Apple's Shortcuts-app.) It's the fastest way to set it as wallpaper; unfortunately this is a system feature which apps themselves are not allowed to do. For the shortcut to set input as wallpaper, see: https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/76277012770b4d90b26244820b8d3162 )
